        # Prometheus is relied upon to monitor services for sending alerts to site admins when
        # something is wrong with Sourcegraph, thus its memory requests and limits are the same to
        # guarantee it has enough memory to perform its job reliably and prevent conflicts with
        # other pods on the same host node.

        # The limit chosen here is based on what works reliably on Sourcegraph.com with lots
