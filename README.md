# Sourcegraph on Kubernetes

[![sourcegraph: search](https://img.shields.io/badge/sourcegraph-search-brightgreen.svg)](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph) [![master build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/018ed23ed79d7297e7dd109b745597c58d875323fb06e81786.svg?branch=master)](https://buildkite.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph)

## Important Notice

ðŸš¨ The [deploy-sourcegraph-k8s](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-k8s) repository is now the preferred and officially supported repository for deploying Sourcegraph on Kubernetes.

All new Sourcegraph Kubernetes (without Helm) deployments should use the [deploy-sourcegraph-k8s](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-k8s) repository. Existing deployments will continue to receive security and critical bugfix updates in this repository for the time being. However, we recommend migrating to the [deploy-sourcegraph-k8s](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-k8s) repository for the best experience and to ensure you have the latest features and improvements. Please refer to the [migration docs for Kustomize](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/deploy/kubernetes/kustomize/migrate) for more information.

Both repositories will be supported in parallel until further notice. All new changes and updates will be made in the [deploy-sourcegraph-k8s](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-k8s) repository and sync'd to this repository when possible. We recommend using [deploy-sourcegraph-k8s](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-k8s) for the most current deployment options.

Please contact us at support@sourcegraph.com if you have any concerns or questions about this migration. Thank you!

## Deploying

Deploying Sourcegraph into a Kubernetes cluster is for organizations that need highly scalable and
available code search and code intelligence. This repository contains documentation for creating,
updating, and maintaining a Sourcegraph cluster.

> IMPORTANT: When upgrading Sourcegraph, please check [upgrading docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/updates/kubernetes) to check if any manual migrations are necessary.
>
> The `master` branch tracks development. Use the branch of this repository corresponding to the
> version of Sourcegraph you wish to deploy, e.g. `git checkout 3.19`.

For product and [pricing](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing/) information, visit
[about.sourcegraph.com](https://about.sourcegraph.com) or [contact
us](https://about.sourcegraph.com/contact/sales) for more information. If you're just starting out,
we recommend running Sourcegraph as a [single Docker
container](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/#quickstart-guide) or using [Docker
Compose](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/docker-compose). Migrating to Sourcegraph on
Kubernetes is easy later.
