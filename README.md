Sourcegraph Data Center is for organizations that need highly scalable and available code search and
code intelligence. This repository contains documentation for creating, updating, and maintaining a
Sourcegraph Data Center cluster using Kubernetes.

For product and [pricing](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing/) information,

or [contact us](https://about.sourcegraph.com/contact/sales) for more information. If you're just
starting out, we recommend installing [Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs) on a single
node first. Migrating to Data Center is easy when you're ready.
