Deploying Sourcegraph into a Kubernetes cluster is for organizations that need highly scalable and
available code search and code intelligence. This repository contains documentation for creating,
updating, and maintaining a Sourcegraph cluster.

For product and [pricing](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing/) information, visit
[about.sourcegraph.com](https://about.sourcegraph.com) or [contact
us](https://about.sourcegraph.com/contact/sales) for more information. If you're just starting out,
we recommend running Sourcegraph as a [single Docker
container](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/#quickstart-guide) or using [Docker
Compose](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/docker-compose). Migrating to Sourcegraph on
Kubernetes is easy later.
