# REMOVE THIS BEFORE MERGING

[old-cluster.yaml](old-cluster.yaml) includes manifests generated from the old (exisitng) cluster.

[new-old-cluster.yaml](new-old-cluster.yaml) includes manifests generated by the [old-base default overlay](../../overlays/old-base/default), which generate resources we are currently using on the old (exisitng) cluster: `kubectl kustomize new/overlays/quick-start/old-base/default -o cluster-preview/new-old-cluster.yaml`

The only difference between these two generated clusters:

1. `fsGroupChangePolicy: OnRootMismatch` is added to `node-exporter` DaemonSet in the new-old cluster, while the old cluster is using the default value which is `fsGroupChangePolicy: Always`
2. The new-old-cluster includes the ConfigMap for frontend-env which the new cluster is using for storing env vars. It must be included during the manifest-building process for components created for the new cluster to work with the old cluster; however, it will not be deployed when running the `kubectl apply -l deploy=sourcegraph` as the label `deploy=sourcegraph` is not included
