# Component - ready to use

Components in this directory are all functional and do not require additional configurations as they were already pre-configured for different purposes.

Do not make any custom changes to the components in this folder.

If you would like to modify a component from this directory, it is strongly recommend to do that by creating a duplicate within the components directory and make you changes there to avoid conflicts during upgrades.
