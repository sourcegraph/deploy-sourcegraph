# Component - ready to use

All components in this directory are all functional as they are pre-configured for different purposes and do not require additional configurations to be used as a component.

Do not make any custom changes to the components in this folder.

If you would like to modify a component from this directory, it is strongly recommend to do that by creating a copy inside the [config directory](../config/), and make you changes there to avoid conflicts and confusions during upgrades.
