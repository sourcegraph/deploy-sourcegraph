- starter code
- directory layout:
  * k8st library (provides primitive transformers)
    - should also provide basic kustomization framework
  * commonCustomizations: high level transforms, building on top of k8st
  * index.ts, executes main, from sources
  * config.ts: declaratively specifies changes
